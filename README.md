Nasa Search with Nasa API

- Note `create-react-app` was used for the initial set up of this Project
- For more professional long serving projects, it would be best to build a bespoke setup.

- Advancements going forward
- Due to time constraints I was unable to get the videos running correctly, as such I would first make sure the videos ran as expected.
- I would also implement some unit testing with Jest and user testing with Cypress
- I would look to smooth out all actions with loaders and transitions/animations.
- I would make the lazy load more aesthetically pleasing and smoother to load.
- I would Do more comprehensive browser and device testing.
